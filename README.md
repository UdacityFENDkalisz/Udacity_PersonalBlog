# Udacity Personal Blog

> Personal, multi-page blog website, created for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree. Used best practices for content and page styling with HTML and CSS. Gained practice using responsive layouts, Flexbox, and CSS Grid to create the structure and design for my blog. Blog created to feature my time hiking in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and exploring the breweries all over the state - two of my favorite hobbies!
